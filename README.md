**Pharmacy Management System**
**Project Description**
The Pharmacy Management System is a software solution developed for a small pharmacy to efficiently manage their stock of medicines, track daily sales, and ensure effective prescription handling. The system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for salespersons and comprehensive management tools for tracking sales and stock status.

**Features:**
_(1) Medicine Management:_
        Maintain a database of medicines in csv with details such as name, expiration date, quantity, and storage location.
        Utilize a linked list to efficiently manage and traverse the list of medicines.
__(2) Sales and Invoicing:_
        Salespersons can input medicines from prescriptions, and the system generates an invoice for the transaction.
        Linked lists are used to represent the prescription details and generate invoices.
_(3) Stock Tracking:_
        Track the availability of medicines in different bins, providing real-time information to the salespersons.
        Implement a hash table to map medicine names to their respective storage bins for quick retrieval.
_(4) Sales Analytics:_
        Management can track daily, weekly, monthly, and annual sales.
        Utilize data structures such as linked lists and queues to efficiently store and analyze sales data over time.
_(5) Expiration Alerts:_
        The system generates alerts when a medicine is about to expire.
        Implement a queue to manage and process expiration alerts in a timely manner.
_(5) Out-of-Stock Alerts:_
        Generate alerts when a medicine is running low or about to be out of stock.
        Use a hash table to efficiently track and monitor stock levels.

**Technologies Used:**
_Programming Language_: Python
_User Interface_      : Tkinter
_Data Structures _    :
                        Linked List: For efficient traversal and management of medicines and prescriptions.
                        Hash Table : For quick retrieval of medicine storage locations.
                        Queue      : For managing expiration alerts in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner.
